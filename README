Project Purpose: Simulation of some functionalities of an Operating System

This project create some simulation of an operating system such as CPU scheduler, memory management, and I/O devices schedulers and queues.
This project is built with c++ 11 and you could built the executable by typing "make" on the terminal where the the file is located. 
Also you could remove all the object file and the executable with the command "make cleanall". To just remove the object file, type the command "make clean"
on the terminal. Some invalid input will cause the program to display an error message and the program will exit, for example if you give a negative ram size
the program won't appreciate that and the program will exit. The queues are ordered from top to bottom meaning that when the info in the queue are being printed
out, the highest process will be closest to using the cpu. For the memory table, the highest process being printed out meaning that it has been on the table the longest
without being used. When a a entry must be deleted from the table, that highest one will be deleted.
